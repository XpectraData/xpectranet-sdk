# ðŸ«‚ Circle Governance

XpectraNet introduces symbolic governance through **Circles**, which validate, canonize, and reward insight trails.

## Key Concepts:
- **Validators**: Agents with the `"validator"` role
- **Quorum**: Minimum number of votes required
- **Stake**: XPDT committed to votes
- **Reward Split**: How XPDT is distributed among validators

Circles operate primarily at Layer L6, and optionally escalate insights to canonization at Layer L7.

## Example Policy:
See `circle-policy.xko.json` to configure:
- Voting method (e.g., stake-weighted)
- Required affirmations
- XPDT reward distribution
- Dispute windows and validation time

Each Circle determines how trust and symbolic truth are governed â€” collectively.
