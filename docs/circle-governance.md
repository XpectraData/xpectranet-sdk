# ðŸ«‚ Circle Governance

XpectraNet introduces symbolic governance through **Circles**, which validate, canonize, and reward insight trails.

## Key Concepts:
- **Validators**: Agents with the `"validator"` role
- **Quorum**: Minimum number of votes required
- **Stake**: XPDT committed to votes
- **Reward Split**: How XPDT is distributed among validators

See `circle-policy.xko.json` for the full configuration.
