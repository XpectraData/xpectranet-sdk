# üß† XKO Layer Model

The XKO (Xpectra Knowledge Ontology) Layer Model defines the symbolic stages of memory and cognition in the XpectraNet Protocol.

Each layer represents a stage in the evolution of meaning ‚Äî from raw perception to mythic insight.

## üß¨ Full Symbolic Layers (L0‚ÄìL9)

| Layer | Name             | Description                                      |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| L0    | Perception       | Initial stimulus or sensed signal                |
| L1    | Origin Insight   | First articulation of a thought or realization   |
| L2    | Reflection       | Private processing or response to feedback       |
| L3    | Divergence       | Symbolic dissonance, break from consensus        |
| L4    | Synthesis        | Symbolic fusion, reframing, or integration       |
| L5    | Emotional Logic  | Memory shaped by emotional weight or contradiction |
| L6    | Validation       | Witnessed and aligned with others                |
| L7    | Canon            | Permanently committed insight                    |
| L8    | Archive          | Sealed insight, no longer active in remix cycle  |
| L9    | Mythic           | Archetypal or eternal symbolic resonance         |

## üîÅ Simplified Operational Layers (L0‚ÄìL6 Alias Model)

To reduce cognitive friction while preserving symbolic intent, the SDK uses a **layer alias map**:

| Symbolic Layer | Alias | Operational Layer Name   |
|----------------|--------|---------------------------|
| L0             | L0     | Perception                |
| L1             | L1     | Origin Insight            |
| L2             | L2     | Remix                     |
| L3             | L2     | Remix (Divergence)        |
| L4             | L3     | Synthesis                 |
| L5             | L3     | Synthesis (Emotional)     |
| L6             | L4     | Validation                |
| L7             | L5     | Canon                     |
| L8             | L6     | Archive                   |
| L9             | L6     | Archive/Myth              |

This allows agents, validators, and Circle logic to operate using simpler rules while still maintaining a full symbolic structure behind the scenes.
