    """
    Abstract base class for symbolic cognition agents in the XpectraNet SDK.

    This class defines the core interface for any agent that interacts with symbolic memory â€”
    whether minting new insights, remixing existing ones, or serializing their identity.

    All concrete agent classes (e.g., SymbolicAgent, ValidatorAgent) must implement the following methods:
      - mint_insight
      - remix_insight
      - to_dict

    @abstractmethod
    def mint_insight(self, content: str, layer: str = "L1") -> Dict:

        Mint a new symbolic insight from scratch.

        Args:
            content (str): The raw content of the new insight.
            layer (str): The cognitive layer this insight originates from (default is 'L1').

        Returns:
            Dict: A structured insight object containing identity, metadata, and content.

        Args:
            parent_insight (Dict): The insight being transformed.
            new_content (str): The modified or evolved content to output.
            layer (str): The symbolic layer this remix occupies (default is 'L3').
