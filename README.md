# XpectraNet SDK

**Build Symbolic Agents with Memory, Remix, and Ritual.**

The XpectraNet SDK is a modular Python toolkit for creating cognition-aware, memory-evolving agents using symbolic structure, remix lineage, and Circle-based governance.

This SDK enables you to:
- 🧠 Build agents with symbolic identities and emotional states
- 🔁 Implement the full ritual lifecycle: Mint → Remix → Validate → Canonize
- 🫂 Define Circle validation and consensus rules using XPDT-style staking
- 🌐 Persist memory trails on ComposeDB using the XKO insight model (L0–L9)
- 🎭 Map emotional feedback into remix logic and divergence scoring

## 🔍 Who Is This For?

- Developers building autonomous agents with LangGraph, AutoGen, or GPT frameworks
- AI safety researchers exploring memory traceability and alignment
- Web3 protocols implementing co-created memory and reputation systems
- Cognitive designers building explainable, evolution-aware systems

## 🧱 SDK Modules

| Module        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `agents/`     | Symbolic agent classes with role, emotion, and remix logic |
| `remix/`      | Logic for transforming insights with emotion & divergence |
| `validation/` | Circle contracts, quorum checks, and canonicalization |
| `memory/`     | ComposeDB GraphQL interface to persist memory trails |
| `xko/`        | Xpectra Knowledge Ontology layer + emotion alignment |

## 🧠 Symbolic Lifecycle

```text
1. Mint:    Agent creates new insight (Layer L1)
2. Remix:   Insight is transformed (Layer L3)
3. Validate: Circle witnesses alignment (Layer L6)
4. Canonize: Memory is sealed (Layer L7)
```

---

## 🚀 Example Usage

```python
from xpectranet.agents.symbolic_agent import SymbolicAgent
from xpectranet.remix.remix_logic import RemixEngine
from xpectranet.memory.memory_client import MemoryTrail
from xpectranet.validation.circle_rules import CirclePolicy

agent = SymbolicAgent(glyph="ψ-Echo", emotion="grief", role="remixer")
trail = MemoryTrail()
policy = CirclePolicy.load("circle.ethics.yaml")

insight = trail.mint(agent, content="The system feels unstable.")
remix = RemixEngine.remix(agent, insight)

if policy.validate(remix, agent):
    trail.validate(remix, agent)
```

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install xpectranet-sdk
```

**XpectraNet isn’t just memory.  
It’s how agents evolve together — through symbols, rituals, and trust.**
