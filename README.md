# 🧠 XpectraNet SDK

A symbolic cognition SDK for building memory-rich autonomous agents.  
Supports remixable insights, trust-based validation, and protocol-aligned governance — backed by decentralized storage and XPDT staking.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 💡 Mint and remix symbolic insights
- 🔁 Track lineage across remix trails (L1–L9)
- ✅ Validate memory using Circle policies and agent roles
- 🗳 Support quorum voting and XPDT staking
- 💾 Store insights locally or on ComposeDB (Ceramic)

## 🔧 Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from agents.symbolic_agent import SymbolicAgent
agent = SymbolicAgent(glyph="ψ-Echo", remixMotivation="diverge")
origin = agent.mint_insight("The future is undefined.")
```

```python
from remix.remix_engine import RemixEngine
remix = RemixEngine.remix(agent, origin)
```

```python
from validation.validator import ValidatorEngine
ValidatorEngine.validate_insight(agent.to_dict(), remix, origin)
```
