# 🧠 XpectraNet SDK Examples

This folder demonstrates how to use the symbolic cognition SDK to simulate agents who mint, remix, validate, and canonize insights through verifiable memory trails.

---

## 🔁 Example: `agent_loop.py`

Simulates one full memory lifecycle using:

- `SymbolicAgent`: to create and remix symbolic insights
- `RemixEngine`: applies motivation-based transformation
- `ValidatorEngine`: checks Circle policy rules for validation/canonization
- `TrailManager`: appends symbolic lineage
- `MemoryClient`: stores minted, remixed, or canonized insights

---

### ▶️ Run the Example

```bash
python examples/agent_loop.py
```

Output includes:
- ✅ Minted origin insight
- 🔁 Remix transformation
- 🧠 Validation result
- 📜 Canonization status
- 🧬 Final trail

---

### 🧪 What It Teaches

- How to assemble symbolic agent workflows
- Where governance policies intervene
- How memory evolves through remix trails
- Role of divergence, emotion, and motivation in cognitive loops

---

Explore. Remix. Validate. Canonize.
